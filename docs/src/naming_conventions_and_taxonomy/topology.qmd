Terraform deploymenst repo:

``` yml
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.

# Global rule:
# Teams
*                           @analytics-ds/write_team
*                           @analytics-ds/maintain_team
*                           @analytics-ds/admin_team

/dev/*.tf                   @analytics-ds/write_team @analytics-ds/maintain_team 
/dev/modules/non_critical   @analytics-ds/write_team @analytics-ds/maintain_team

# Maintain team manages core infrastructure code in dev
/dev/modules/core           @analytics-ds/maintain_team
