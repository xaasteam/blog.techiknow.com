## GitHub Organization Naming Convention

The GitHub organization for the Analytics and Data Science team should follow this naming convention: `analytics-ds`

This clearly identifies the organization as belonging to the Analytics and Data Science team.

## GitHub Repository Naming Convention

The repositories within the `analytics-ds` GitHub organization should follow this naming convention: `<project-name>-<repo-type>`

Where:

-   `<project-name>` is a short, descriptive name for the project or initiative the repository is associated with.
-   `<repo-type>` is one of the following values:
-   `data`: for repositories containing data files, datasets, or data processing code.
-   `models`: for repositories containing machine learning models, model training code, or model deployment artifacts.
-   `etl`: for repositories containing extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines or scripts.
-   `viz`: for repositories containing data visualization code, dashboards, or reporting tools.
-   `infra`: for repositories containing infrastructure as code, deployment configurations, or DevOps tooling.
-   `docs`: for repositories containing project documentation, wikis, or other non-code artifacts.

Examples of repository names following this convention:

-   `customer-churn-data`
-   `fraud-detection-models`
-   `sales-pipeline-etl`
-   `marketing-dashboard-viz`
-   `data-platform-infra`
-   `project-roadmap-docs`

This naming convention helps organize repositories by their primary purpose, making it easier to navigate the codebase and understand the contents of each repository at a glance.
